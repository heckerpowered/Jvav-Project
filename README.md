# Introdution
Jvav is a programming language first proposed by Dr. Haoyang Zhang and implemented by Mr. Rick Astley (aka. [Heckerpowered](https://github.com/heckerpowered)).

Jvav is toy like, but we still want to develop it into a powerful language.Jvav compiler can convert Jvav source code to equivalent Java, C# or C++ source code, or compile to C#, Java intermediate language.

# Jvav is now developing
Jvav is in development right now, so it's not available yet.
